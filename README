subsurface2srt makes subtitles for a scuba video
containing dive computer information

subsurface2srt converts a dive xml file containing
one dive output from subsurface into an SRT subtitles
file that can then be played alongside a video; for
example in vlc, choose video... subtitles... open

You need to make sure the output file contains only
one dive - I do this by editing the xml by hand.

Tested against (the admittedly old) subsurface
v1.2

The first commandline parameter specifies the
input xml file; the second file specifies how
far into the video the dive computer starts logging
(usually just after the beginning of initial
descent).

Example:

subsurface2srt ./test.subsurface "3:20 min" > ~/tmp/st/c.srt 


Build:

Prereqs: Haskell - eg apt-get install haskell-platform

Build subsurface2srt by:
  cabal install

Add ~/.cabal/bin/ to your PATH
